**Boring was so yesterday!** Recently, I embarked on a journey to give my 11ty website a fresh and exciting look. It's amazing how a few tweaks can transform your online presence and create a more engaging experience for visitors. In this post, I'll take you through the exhilarating changes I made to my site, from aligning the logo with the header to jazzing up the background color, and even a bit of spring cleaning by removing some template posts. Buckle up; it's going to be a wild ride!

## Logo Alignment: Finding Harmony

Ever felt like something was just slightly off? That's how I felt about my website's logo. It didn't quite align with the header, and it was high time for a change. So, I rolled up my sleeves and got to work.

The result? Aligning the logo with the header not only looks sleek and professional but also brings a sense of harmony to the entire layout. It's like that satisfying click when puzzle pieces finally fit together.

## Background Color: Splash of Personality

Say goodbye to the bland! The website's old background color had all the excitement of a grayscale TV show. I craved something vibrant and memorable.

After a bit of color palette experimentation, I found *the one*. The new background color added a pop of personality to the site, giving it character and style. It's like giving your website a fresh coat of paint â€“ instantly rejuvenating!

## Streamlining Content: Decluttering the Closet

Ever open your closet and realize you've got a bunch of clothes you never wear? My website had the same problem with outdated template posts. It was time for some digital decluttering.

I removed unnecessary template posts, leaving behind only the gems that truly represented my content. It's like cleaning out your closet and rediscovering your favorite outfits.

## Conclusion: Embrace the Adventure

In the world of web design, even the smallest changes can set your website on a thrilling journey. By aligning my logo, choosing a vibrant background color, and tidying up my content, I gave my 11ty site a brand-new personality.

Remember, your website is your digital playground. Don't be afraid to have fun with it! Regularly refreshing and improving its design keeps it exciting for both you and your visitors.
